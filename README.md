### ChatGPT4 and Mistral AI with MySQL Integration

The chatbot processes a user's query in natural language, converts it into a SQL query via GPT-4, executes it on a connected SQL database, and delivers the results back to the user in an easy-to-understand conversational format. This end-to-end process, integrated into a Streamlit application, combines the OpenAI API with efficient database interactions to deliver seamless, real-time insights.
